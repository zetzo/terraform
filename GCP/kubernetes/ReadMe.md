This code creates a Compute Engine instance with the name k8s-node in the europe-central2-a zone. It uses the Ubuntu 18.04 LTS image as the boot disk and installs Kubernetes using the apt package manager. It also starts the kubelet service and enables it to start on boot.

The instance is marked as a Kubernetes minion by setting the k8s-minion metadata key to true.

This Terraform code will create a single Kubernetes node in GCP. To create a full Kubernetes cluster, you will need to create additional nodes and configure them to join the cluster using kubeadm.
